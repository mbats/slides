					<aside class="notes">
				        Hi, I'm Melanie Bats and I work as software developer at Obeo. 
					I'm here to present you the developments I did to turn the Eclipse IDE into an Arduino programming platform for kids.

					<h2>Curiosity</h2>
					<p>
						Explore, question and learn
					</p>
					<img src="images/curiosity2.jpg"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						Children are such curious creatures. They explore, question, and wonder, and by doing so, learn. From the moment of birth, likely even before, humans are meant to learn new things. When we are curious about something new, we want to explore it.
					</aside>
				</section>
	

				<section>
					<h2>Discover by yourself</h2>
					<p>
						Explore to understand cause and effects.
					</p>
					<img src="images/discover2.jpg"/>
					<aside class="notes">
					A good way to discover is to explore by yourself, trying, encountering success and failures. This way, kids learn causes and effects.
					</aside>

					<h2>Computers are everywhere</h2>
					<p>
						To understand the world, you need to understand how computers work
					</p>
					<img src="images/computer.jpg"/>
					<aside class="notes">
					Today, the world is made of computers. At home, in TVs, DVD players, coffee machines, electronic toys, pet robots... outside in cars, planes, phones... Nowadays kids are used to play with tablets and computers. They are curious to understand how a video game is created, how computers works and what is electronic...
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Understand electronics</h2>
					<p>
						Play with sensors and actuators
					</p>
					<img src="images/electronics.jpg"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						One of the thing kids have to learn is electronics. The idea to learn electronics for  them is mostly to understand that they can use sensors to listen to the environment and that it exists actuators with which they can interact. We expect that the yunderstand that these modules are connected to a platform which contains software.
					</aside>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Open hardware</h2>
					<p>
						<a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>
					</p>
					<img src="images/open-hardware.jpg"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						Nowadays, it is really easy to get good material to learn electronics thanks to the open hardware initiative. What is open hardware ? Open source hardware is a licensing agreement for electromechanical projects. That is to say, electronics and robotics and other mechanical projects are open hardware if they are documented and published under an open hardware license. The most famous open hardware platform is Arduino. With Arduino you get a piece of hardware, but also documentation and a development environment that fits all together with hardware.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Arduino kits</h2>
					<p>
						Cheap, easy to find thanks to many different providers : <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/">AdaFruit</a>, <a href="http://www.dfrobot.com">DFRobot</a>, <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com">SeeedStudio</a>, <a href="http://snootlab.com/">SnootLab</a>, ...
					</p>
					<p>
						So many kinds of modules available!
					</p>
					<img src="images/arduino-starter-kit.jpg"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						What's great with arduino is that it is cheap and really easy to find. There are many efficient providers available on internet like adafruit, DFRobot, SeeedStudio. They provide an incredible amount of modules! Order and two days later you will receive at home your new toy.

					<h2>Create with electronic</h2>
					<p>
						Open hardware dedicated to kids learning electronics : LittleBits
					</p>
					<img src="images/littlebits.jpg"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						The problem with electronic is that it is most of the time small things. So it is not so easy for kids to manipulate. And it is so easy to do a bad connection and just damage your electronic module. Another open hardware company proposed really cool electronic modules to solve this issue : littleBits. littleBits is an opensource library of electronic modules that snap together with tiny magnets. There is no soldering, no wiring, no programming. It's great to understand electronics but not to understand programming and to perceive and comprehend the connection between software and hardware modules.
					</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Understand programming</h2>
					<p>
						Many open source software are dedicated to learn programming to kids : Scratch, TurtleLogo, KidsRuby, Python4Kids...
					</p>
					<p>
						Initiatives : Programatoo, Devoxx4Kids, greenlight, coding goûter...
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						To understand the world the kids have to learn programming. Many different initiatives are arising to learn programming to kids. Theses movements use many different kind of software : open source software, proprietary software, online software. The most famous, TurtleLogo is for the eldest ones. More recently, Scratch has become more popular. These tools have different approaches.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Text</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						In TurtleLogo kids write text to move a small turtle cursor in order to draw shapes. No graphical UI, very simple language. They learn the concepts of instructions and understand that a program is just a suite of instructions.
					</aside>
					<img src="images/logo.png"/>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Graphical</h2>
					<img src="images/scratch.png"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						In Scratch you drag and drop elements from a palette to animate a character. This tool is a complete IDE which allows kids to create cartoons, video games, movies... This tool provides a more graphical UI. Kids have to assemble puzzle pieces to describe instructions.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Program the real world</h2>
					<img src="images/scratch4arduino.jpg"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						These tools are great to learn what programming is. It exists other kind of tools that allows kid to program the real world by interacting with sensors and actuators. Open source tools like Scratch4Arduino or Ardublock provide UIs for simple programming of the Arduino platform. Thanks to these tools, kids can develop a software, upload and run it on hardware platforms. 
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Eclipse IDE for developpers</h2>
					<p>
Complex UI, concepts (perpsectives, project lifecycle...), languages (Java, C)  
					</p>
					<img src="images/eclipse.jpg"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						Eclipse is one of the most famous IDE. It has million of users all over the world. So why kids do not use it also to learn electronics and programming? In fact it does not exist any Eclipse plugin dedicated to kids. And we know that the Eclipse UI and default available languages as Java or C are to complex for kids to discover programming.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Turning Eclipse an IDE for kids</h2>
					<p>
						Graphical programming & light UI
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						The idea was to develop a prototype to allow kids to create small program. Our first actions were to simplify the UI, the project lifecycle and to provide a graphical block language to be able to develop simple programs and run them on electronic modules. The purpose is not to provide a complete IDE but a tool giving the possibility to discover the effects a software program could have on electronic modules. 
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>A simplified UI</h2>
					<p>
						No menu, only a  toolbar with 4 buttons activated according to what is possible
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						The UI defines no menu just one toolbar with 4 different buttons to : manage project lifecycle, define the hardware modules used and to define the sketch that would be uploaded on the hardware platform.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Dashboard</h2>
						<ul>Indicate the process :
							<li>Define connection between hardware platform and modules</li>
							<li>Describe the sketch</li>
							<li>Upload on the target</li>
						</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						A dashboard helps the user by indicating what is the next step in the process development. The process is really simple in fact. The user must describe the connection between the hardware modules. Then he describes a sketch and finally he uploads the sketch to the target.
					</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Hardware</h2>
					<p>
						Platform, Modules, Wire
					</p>
					<img src="images/hardware.png"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						First step, the kid defines the hardware platform he is using and the different sensors and actuators he connects to the Arduino. 
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Sketch</h2>
					<p>
						Graphical block-based language
					</p>
					<img src="images/sketch.png"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						Software written using Arduino are called sketches. Then the kid describes the sketch which represents the software that would run on the hardware platform. And finally, he uploads the sketch to the target. 
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Sirius</h2>
					<p>
						A tool to quickly define DSL based <strong>custom multi-view workbenches</strong> with dedicated representations
					</p>
					<img src="images/logo_Sirius.png"/>

					<aside class="notes">
				       	To develop the graphical designers I used Sirius. Sirius is a new project in Eclipse to quickly define multi view workbenches based on DSL with dedicated representations.
    					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Why using Sirius ?</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>For the tool <em>development</em> phase : Dynamic & iterative (live) development</li>
							<li>For <em>kids</em> : Tooling adapted to the development of arduino small projects</li>
						</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
				       	So why am I using Sirius?
					During the prototype development phase, it allows me to develop really quickly an arduino specific modeler. The development is easy, dynamic and iterative thanks to a live preview. I choose it also because I am used to work with Sirius in my daily work as I use it also to develop another software UML Designer.
					For the kids, they get a tooling completely adapted to the development of small arduino projects and really simple to use.
    					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Arduino designer development</h2>
					<h3>Step 1 - Arduino DSL</h3>
					<p>
						DSL describing what are Arduino hardware modules and sketches
					</p>
					<img src="images/metamodel.png"/>
					<aside class="notes">
				       	First step in the development of the arduino designers : I defined a new DSL specific to Arduino which allows me to describe Arduino hardware and software sketches.
    					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Arduino designer development</h2>
					<h3>Step 2 - Arduino diagram specification</h3>
					<p>
						Sirius specification
					</p>
					<img src="images/vsm.png"/>
					<aside class="notes">
				       	Second step, I defined the different kinds of representations I wanted. Then I mapped the different concepts defined in Arduino metamodel to graphical elements and defines the different tools provided by the designer.
    					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Arduino designer development</h2>
					<h3>Step 3 - Code generator</h3>
					<p>
						Generate ino files with Acceleo
					</p>
					<pre><code data-trim>
int brightness;
void setup() {
  brightness=0;
}
void loop() {
 while ((brightness<255))
 {
  brightness=(brightness+1);
  analogWrite(11,255-(brightness));
  delay(8);
 }
 while ((brightness>1))
 {
  brightness=(brightness-1);
  analogWrite(11,255-(brightness));
  delay(8);
 }
 delay(200);
}
					</code></pre>
					<aside class="notes">
					Next step was to develop a small generator with Acceleo to generate from Arduino's model the sketch. In Arduino, sketches are saved with the file extension .ino. The Arduino language is based on C/C++. It links against AVR Libc and allows the use of any of its functions. The AVR Libc package provides a subset of the standard C library for Atmel AVR microcontrollers. If we have a look to the generated code : we can see that Arduino programs can be divided in three main parts: structure (setup, loop, if, repeat, while...), values (variables and constants), and functions (pinMode, digitalWrite, analogRead...). The setup() function is called when a sketch starts. It is used to initialize variables, pin modes, start using libraries, etc. The setup function will only run once, after each powerup or reset of the Arduino board. After creating a setup() function, the loop() function loops consecutively, allowing the program to change and respond.
    					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Arduino designer development</h2>
					<h3>Step 4 - Integrate Arduino compiler</h3>
					<p>
						arduino.mk
					</p>
					<p>
						Generate Makefile with Acceleo
					</p>
					<p>					
						make
					</p>
					<pre><code data-trim>
BOARD_TAG    = uno
ARDUINO_PORT = /dev/ttyACM0
ARDUINO_LIBS = Servo

include /usr/share/arduino/Arduino.mk</code></pre>
					<aside class="notes">
					When you use the Arduino environment the compile and upload actions are directly integrated. Here as I want to integrate the generation and the compilation of ino files in my Eclipse application, I searched how to compile and upload Arduino programs from the command line. As I am a Ubuntu user, I just grab the arduino-mk package and set up some environment variables. Then I updated my generator in order to generate also small Makefile for the sketch. Then the upload action will just have to call the make command for building. After building, a new directory has been created which contains all the object files.
    					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Arduino designer development</h2>
					<h3>Step 5 - Integrate target uploader</h3>
					<p>
 						avr-gcc, avrdude
					</p>
					<p>
 						make upload
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
					To be able to upload the code on the target, I also installed avr-gcc which is a cross-compiler for the AVR chip that runs the Arduino and avrdude. avrdude is a very handy utility for loading code onto Atmel AVR microcontrollers. As Arduino ships with its own bootloader, it is possible to load and run code using only a single USB cable connecting the computer to the board. This cable comes with my Ardublock kit.
					Thanks to arduino.mk, uploading the code on the hardware platform is then really easy. My Eclipse upload action has just to call the make upload command.

					<h2>Prototype based on DFRobot Ardublock kit</h2>
					<p>
						Sensors : ambient light, infrared , sound, push button, rotation
					</p>
					<p>
						Actuators : LEDs, micro servo motors, fan
					</p>
					<img src="images/ardublock-kit.jpg"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						For the prototype I will demonstrate, I am going to use the DFRobot ardublock kit which contains: ambient light sensor, infrared sensor, sound sensor, push buttons, rotation sensor. It has some servo motors and we also bought a fan. It contains also an I/O extension shield.

						A pet robot
					</p>
					<img src="images/cat-robot.jpg"/>
					<aside class="notes">
				       	As you can see the Arduino designer allows to develop really simple projects. But thanks to the different function I already demonstrates I am able to build more complex projects. So why not to build a robot.
