					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
				        Hi, I'm Melanie Bats and I work as software developer at Obeo. 
					I'm here to present you the developments I did to turn the Eclipse IDE into an Arduino programming platform for kids.

					<h2>Curiosity</h2>
					<p>
						Explore, question and learn
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Children are such curious creatures. They explore, question, and wonder, and by doing so, learn. From the moment of birth, likely even before, humans are meant to learn new things. When we are curious about something new, we want to explore it.
					</aside>
				</section>
	

				<section>
					<h2>Discover by yourself</h2>
					<p>
						Explore to understand cause and effects.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
					A good way to discover is to explore by yourself, trying, encountering success and failures. This way, kids learn causes and effects.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Computers are everywhere</h2>
					<p>
						To understand the world, you need to understand how computers work
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
					Today, the world is made of computers. At home, in TVs, DVD players, coffee machines, electronic toys, pet robots... outside in cars, planes, phones... Nowadays kids are used to play with tablets and computers. They are curious to understand how a video game is created...
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Understand electronics</h2>
					<p>
						Play with sensors and actuators
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						The idea to learn electronics is to understand that there are sensors to listen to the environment and actuators with which you can interact. These modules are connected to a platform which contains software.
					</aside>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Open hardware</h2>
					<p>
						Arduino
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						????
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Arduino kits</h2>
					<p>
						Cheap, easy to find thanks to many different providers : AdaFruit, DFRobot, SnootLab, ...
						So many kinds of modules available!
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						What's great with arduino is that it is cheap and really easy to find. There are many efficient providers available on internet. Order and two days later you will receive at home your new toy.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Prototype based on DFRobot starter kit</h2>
					<p>
						Sensors to detect: ambient light, infrared , sound, push button, rotation
						Actuators : LEDs, micro servo motors, fan
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						For the prototype, I am going to use the DFRobot starter kit which contains: ambient light sensor, infrared sensor, sound sensor, push buttons, rotation sensor. It has some servo motors and we also bought a fan.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Understand programming</h2>
					<p>
						Many open source software are dedicated to learn programming to kids : Scratsh, TurtleLogo, Ruby4Kids, Python4Kids...
						See : Programatoo, Devoxx4Kids...
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						There are already many existing open source software for kids to learn programming. The most famous, TurtleLogo is for the eldest ones. More recently, Scratch has become more popular. These tools have different approaches.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Text</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						In TurtleLogo you write text to move a small turtle in order to draw something. No graphical UI, very simple language.
					</aside>
				</section>
<section>
					<h2>Graphical</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						In Scratch you drag and drop elements from a palette to animate a character. This tool is a complete IDE which allows kids to create cartoons, video games, movies...
					</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Eclipse IDE for developpers</h2>
					<p>
Complex UI, concepts (perpsectives, project lifecycle...), languages (Java, C)  
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Eclipse is one of the most famous IDE. It is used by more than xxx persons everyday. So why kids do not use it also to learn electronics and programming? The Eclipse UI and default available languages as Java or C are to complex to discover programation.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Turning Eclipse an IDE for kids</h2>
					<p>
						Graphical programming & light UI
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						The idea was to simplify the UI, the project lifecycle and to provide a graphical block language to be able to develop simple programs and run them on electronic modules.The purpose is not to provide a complete IDE but a tool giving the possibility to discover the effects a software program could have on electronic modules. 
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>A simplified UI</h2>
					<p>
						No menu, only a  toolbar with 4 buttons activated according to what is possible
						Dashboard
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						The UI defines no menu just one toolbar with 4 different buttons to : manage project lifecycle, define the hardware modules used and to define the sketch that would be uploaded on the hardware platform. 
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Arduino designer : Dashboard</h2>
					<p>
						Show the process
						<ul>
							<ol>Define connection between hardware platform and modules</ol>
							<ol>Describe the sketch</ol>
							<ol>Upload on the target</ol>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						A dashboard helps the user by showing him what is the next step in the process development. The process is really simple in fact.
					</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Arduino designer : Hardware</h2>
					<p>
						Platform, Modules, Wire
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						First step, the kid defines the hardware platform he is using and the different sensors and actuators he connects to the Arduino. 
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Sketch</h2>
					<p>
						Graphical block-based language
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Then he describes the sketch which represents the software that would run on the hardware platform. And finally, he uploads the sketch to the target. 
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Sirius</h2>
					<p>
						A tool to quickly define DSL based <strong>custom multi-view workbenches</strong> with dedicated representations
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
				       	To develop the graphical designers I used Sirius. Sirius is a new project in Eclipse to quickly define multi view workbenches based on DSL with dedicated representations.
    					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Why using Sirius ?</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>For the tool <em>development</em> phase : Dynamic & iterative (live) development</li>
						</ul>
						<img height="350" src="./images/vsm_runtime.png"/>
							<li>For <em>kids</em> : </li>
							<ul>
								<li>Tooling adapted to the development of arduino small projects</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
				       	So why am I using Sirius?
					During the prototype development phase, it allows me to develop really quickly an arduino specific modeler. The development is easy, dynamic and iterative thanks to a live preview. I choose it also because I am used to work with Sirius in my daily work as I use it also to develop another software UML Designer.
					For the kids, they get a tooling completely adapted to the development of small arduino projects and really simple to use.
    					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Arduino designer development : Phase 1 - Arduino DSL</h2>
					<p>
						DSL describing what are Arduino hardware modules and sketches
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
				       	First step in the development of the arduino designers : I defined a new DSL specific to Arduino which allows me to describe Arduino hardware and software sketches.
    					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Arduino designer development : Phase 2 - Arduino diagram specification</h2>
					<p>
						Sirius specification
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
				       	Second step, I defined the different kinds of representations I wanted. Then I mapped the different concepts defined in Arduino metamodel to graphical elements and defines the different tools provided by the designer.
    					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Hello world</h2>
					<p>
						Blink a LED!
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
				       	For the first demo, I will blink a LED.
    					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Use sensor</h2>
					<p>
						A LED + push button
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
				       	For the next demo, I will use a LED and connect it to a push button in order to switch on/off the LED according to the button is pressed or not.
    					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Fade light</h2>
					<p>
						1 LED + programming language
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
				       	The next example demonstrates how to change the brightness of a LED in order to get a fading light.
    					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>A more complex project</h2>
					<p>
						A robot
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
				       	As you can see the Arduino designer allows to develop really simple projects. But thanks to the different function I already demonstrates I am able to build more complex projects. So why not to build a robot.
    					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Tigger</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
				       	I want to present you "Tigger". He is an electronic cat.
